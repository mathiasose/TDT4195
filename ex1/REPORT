PART 1 of HOMEWORK: Write a small paragraph explaining what the
code is doing. In case you are working with LINUX or MAC write another
small paragraph of your setup.

The main function first initializes GLUT with any parameters the compiled file might have been called with. It then initializes the display mode to a single window with RGBA color mode. The rest of the code is pretty straightforward, creating a window of a specified size at a specified position and displaying it. The display function calls draw(), which simply specifies the clear color to be black and clears the entire window buffer.

SETUP:
Ubuntu 14.04, OpenGL 3.0 Mesa 10.1.3, freeglut3. Compiling with g++. Makefile attached with code.

PART 2 of HOMEWORK:
Research and write about three alternatives to GLM;

The Configurable Math Library (CML) is a open source C++ library.

Eigen is an open source C++ library, specializing in linear algebra. Along with classes data structures it also contains complete and well-tested algorithms that solve various problems.

Vectormath is a C/C++ library by Sony. It is the linear algebra component used in the more extensive Bullet graphics framework. It was originally proprietary and only available to licensed Playstation developers, but later open sourced.

PART 3 of HOMEWORK: Deliver your final code.
